# 🐼 Tools in Pandas

---

## 📖 Overview

**Pandas** is a powerful Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides high-performance data structures such as **Series** and **DataFrame** to handle structured data efficiently.

Pandas is widely used in data preprocessing, cleaning, exploration, and analysis. It integrates seamlessly with libraries like **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**, making it a core tool for data science and analytics.

## 🎯 Aim

To study and understand the various tools and functionalities provided by the Pandas library for effective data manipulation, analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

1. Python – Programming language used for implementation.  
2. Pandas – Library for data manipulation and analysis.  
3. Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Interactive environment for coding and testing.  
4. NumPy – Supports numerical operations within Pandas.  
5. Matplotlib / Seaborn – Optional tools for data visualization.

## 📚 Theory and Key Concepts

Pandas provides two primary data structures:

### 1️⃣ Series

- One-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.  
- Can be used to store a single column of data.

### 2️⃣ DataFrame

- Two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.  
- Equivalent to a spreadsheet or SQL table.  
- Supports fast indexing, filtering, and aggregation.

### 3️⃣ Key Pandas Tools

- **Reading and Writing Data**: `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, `to_csv()`, `to_excel()`  
- **Viewing Data**: `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, `describe()`  
- **Indexing & Selection**: `loc[]`, `iloc[]`, column selection  
- **Data Cleaning**: `isnull()`, `dropna()`, `fillna()`  
- **Data Manipulation**: `sort_values()`, `groupby()`, `merge()`, `concat()`  
- **Statistical Functions**: `mean()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `std()`, `min()`, `max()`  
- **Data Transformation**: `apply()`, `map()`, `replace()`
