# Experiment 3: Study of Tuples in Python

## Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study and understand the concept of tuples in Python and to implement various tuple operations. This experiment helps students learn how tuples are used to store fixed collections of data and how they differ from other data structures such as lists.

## Tools Required

The following tools are required to perform this experiment:

* Python 3.x programming language
* Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda distribution recommended)
* Computer or laptop with Windows, Linux, or macOS
* Basic understanding of Python programming

## Theory

Python provides several built-in data structures to store and manage data efficiently. A tuple is one such data structure that is used to store an ordered collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists but have one key difference: tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

Tuples are defined using parentheses `()` and can store elements of different data types such as integers, floats, and strings.

### Characteristics of Tuples

* Ordered: Elements in a tuple have a fixed order and can be accessed using index values
* Immutable: Once created, elements of a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed
* Allows duplicate elements
* Faster than lists due to immutability

### Tuple Operations

The following tuple operations are demonstrated in this experiment:

#### 1. Creating a Tuple

Tuples can be created by placing elements inside parentheses separated by commas.

#### 2. Accessing Tuple Elements

Elements of a tuple can be accessed using index positions starting from zero.

#### 3. Tuple Length

The `len()` function is used to find the number of elements present in a tuple.

#### 4. Tuple Concatenation

Two or more tuples can be combined using the `+` operator.

#### 5. Tuple Repetition

Tuple elements can be repeated using the `*` operator.

#### 6. Membership Operation

The `in` keyword is used to check whether a specific element exists in a tuple.

### Programs Included in the Experiment

* Program to create and display a tuple
* Program to access tuple elements using indexing
* Program to find the length of a tuple
* Program to perform tuple concatenation and repetition
* Program to demonstrate tuple immutability

These programs help students understand how tuples work and where they are best applied.

## Applications

Tuples are widely used in:

* Storing fixed data such as days of the week or coordinates
* Returning multiple values from functions
* Ensuring data integrity where values should not change
* Improving performance in programs requiring constant data

## Advantages of Tuples

* Data security due to immutability
* Faster execution compared to lists
* Can be used as dictionary keys

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully studied tuples and their operations in Python. We learned how to create tuples, access elements, and apply various tuple operations. Understanding tuples is important for efficient data handling and for writing secure and optimized Python programs. This experiment provides a strong foundation for learning advanced data structures in Py
