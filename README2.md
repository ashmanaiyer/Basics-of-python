# Experiment 2: Python Lists and Operations

## Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study and implement the Python list data structure and perform various operations on lists. This experiment helps students understand how to store multiple values in a single variable and manipulate data efficiently using built-in list methods. It also focuses on applying lists to solve real-life problems.

## Tools Required

The following tools are required to perform this experiment:

* Python 3.x programming language
* Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda distribution recommended)
* Computer or laptop with Windows, Linux, or macOS
* Basic knowledge of Python programming and mathematics

## Theory

Python provides several built-in data structures, among which lists are one of the most commonly used. A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements enclosed within square brackets `[]`. Lists can store elements of different data types such as integers, floats, and strings.

### Features of Python Lists

* Ordered: Elements have a defined order and can be accessed using index values
* Mutable: Elements of a list can be modified after creation
* Allows duplicates: Lists can store duplicate values
* Dynamic size: Elements can be added or removed as required

### Basic List Operations

The following list operations are used in this experiment:

#### 1. Creating a List

Lists can be created by placing elements inside square brackets or by using the `list()` constructor.

#### 2. Adding Elements

The `append()` method is used to add new elements to the end of the list.

#### 3. Removing Elements

The `remove()` method is used to delete a specific element from the list.

#### 4. Sorting a List

The `sort()` method is used to arrange elements in ascending or alphabetical order.

#### 5. Accessing List Elements

Elements can be accessed using index positions starting from zero.

### Programs Included in the Experiment

#### 1. Grocery Shopping List Management

This program demonstrates how a list can be used to store grocery items. The user can add items to the list, remove unwanted items, and display the final shopping list.

#### 2. Phone Contacts Management

This program stores contact names in a list and sorts them alphabetically. It demonstrates the use of list sorting and data organization.

#### 3. Temperature Analysis

This program stores daily temperature readings in a list and calculates the average temperature using the stored values. It demonstrates how lists can be used for basic data analysis.

These programs help students understand how lists can represent real-world data efficiently.

## Applications

The concepts learned in this experiment are widely used in:

* Managing collections such as contact lists and shopping carts
* Basic data analysis and statistical calculations
* Building foundations for advanced data structures like stacks, queues, and arrays
* Real-world applications involving data storage and manipulation

## Advantages of Using Lists

* Easy to use and flexible
* Reduces the need for multiple variables
* Supports powerful built-in functions and methods

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully learned about Python lists and their operations. We implemented programs to add, remove, sort, and proces
