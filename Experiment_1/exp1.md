# Experiment 1: Python Programming Environment & Setup

To study the fundamentals of the Python programming language, understand its execution environment, install Python and Jupyter Notebook via the Anaconda distribution, and explore various IDEs including Google Colab
## Objectives

- Understand Python features and real-world applications.
- Setup a local data science environment using Anaconda.
- Explore different Python IDEs (Spyder, PyCharm, VS Code).
- Run Python code in cloud environments like Google Colab.


## Theory 
Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

### Why Python?

Python's popularity in data science and industry is due to several key factors:

* **Simple & Readable:** Syntax is very close to English, making it easy for beginners.
* **Open Source:** It is free to use and has a massive global community.
* **Interpreted Language:** Code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging.
* **Extensive Libraries:** Includes powerful tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis.
* **Versatile:** Used in Web Dev, AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Automation.

###  Companies Using Python
Python is the backbone of many top-tier organizations:
- **Google** (Search engine components)
- **NASA** (Scientific calculations)
- **Netflix** (Recommendation algorithms)
- **Instagram** (Backend infrastructure)

### Why Anaconda?

Anaconda is an open-source distribution that simplifies package management and deployment.

- Pre-installed: Comes with Jupyter, Spyder, and core libraries.

- Environment Management: Easily switch between different project versions.

- Stability: Avoids common library dependency errors.

### Jupyter Notebook

A web-based interactive tool that allows you to combine live code, equations, and visualizations in a single document.




## Installation



### 1. Download Anaconda
- Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com).
- Download the **Individual Edition** for Python 3.x.


### 2. Run the Installer
- Open the downloaded file.
- Follow the setup wizard (use "Just Me" as the recommended setting).
- **Tip:** Check the box "Register Anaconda as my default Python" if you want it to be your primary environment.

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
- Open the **Anaconda Navigator**.
- Click the **Launch** button under the Jupyter Notebook icon.
    
## Deployment



  ## Google Colab (Cloud Execution)

Google Colab is a cloud-based Python environment provided by Google that allows you to write and execute code in your browser with zero configuration.

###  Advantages
- **No installation:** Runs entirely in the cloud.
- **Free Hardware:** Access to free GPUs and TPUs for heavy processing.
- **Easy Collaboration:** Save



## Supported IDEs


| IDE | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IDLE** | Basic Python IDE  |
| **Spyder** | Scientific Python IDE (Anaconda)  |
| **PyCharm** | Professional Python IDE  |
| **VS Code** | Lightweight code editor  |
| **Jupyter Notebook** |Interactive EDA environment  |

## Conclusion

Python provides a flexible and powerful programming environment. Through this experiment, we established a local development setup using the **Anaconda distribution** and **Jupyter Notebook**, which simplifies package management and interactive coding. 

Furthermore, the exploration of **Google Colab** demonstrated how cloud-based environments can be utilized for zero-configuration development and high-performance computing. These tools collectively provide a comprehensive ecosystem for data science and software development.
