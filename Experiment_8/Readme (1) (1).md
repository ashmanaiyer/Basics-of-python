## 📚 Theory and Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ NumPy Arrays (ndarray)

The primary data structure in NumPy is the *ndarray* (N-dimensional array), which supports:

- Multi-dimensional data storage
- Homogeneous data types
- Efficient memory usage
- Fast vectorized operations

---

### 2️⃣ Statistical Functions for EDA

NumPy provides built-in statistical functions that help summarize datasets:

- `mean()` – Calculates average value
- `median()` – Finds middle value
- `std()` – Computes standard deviation
- `var()` – Calculates variance
- `min()` – Identifies minimum value
- `max()` – Identifies maximum value
- `sum()` – Computes total of elements

These functions are essential for understanding data distribution and variation.
