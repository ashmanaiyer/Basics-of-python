# Experiment 1: Basic Python Programming

## Aim

The aim of this experiment is to introduce the fundamentals of Python programming and to develop basic problem-solving skills using simple arithmetic operations and mathematical formulas. Through this experiment, students learn how to write, execute, and understand Python programs that take user input, process data, and display meaningful output.

## Tools Required

The following tools and resources are required to perform this experiment successfully:

* Python 3.x programming language
* Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda distribution preferred)
* A computer or laptop with Windows, Linux, or macOS
* Basic knowledge of mathematics

## Theory

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It is widely used in education, data science, web development, automation, and artificial intelligence due to its simple syntax and readability. Python allows programmers to focus more on problem-solving rather than complex syntax.

In this experiment, the following fundamental Python concepts are used:

### 1. Variables

Variables are used to store data values in memory. In Python, variables do not require explicit declaration and can store different types of data.

### 2. Input and Output

* The `input()` function is used to take input from the user during program execution.
* The `print()` function is used to display output on the screen.

### 3. Type Conversion

The `input()` function returns data as a string. To perform mathematical operations, type conversion using functions such as `int()` or `float()` is required.

### 4. Arithmetic Operators

Python supports various arithmetic operators such as:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)

These operators are used to perform calculations based on user input.

### 5. Mathematical Formulas

The programs in this experiment apply basic mathematical formulas such as:

* Sum and average of numbers
* Area of a circle
* Area of a rectangle
* Perimeter of a rectangle

### Programs Included in the Experiment

1. Program to calculate the sum and average of marks of five subjects
2. Program to calculate the area of a circle using its diameter
3. Program to calculate the area of a rectangle
4. Program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
5. Program to implement a simple calculator

These programs help students understand how real-world mathematical problems can be converted into logical steps and implemented using Python code.

## Applications

The concepts learned in this experiment are widely applicable in:

* Academic problem-solving
* Basic data processing
* Automation of simple calculations
* Building a strong foundation for advanced programming topics

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented basic Python programs using Jupyter Notebook. We learned how to declare variables, take user input, perform type conversion, apply arithmetic operators, and display output. This experiment provides a strong foundation in Python programming and prepares students for more advanced concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and data structures in future experiments.
