AIM

the goal of this experiment is to get comfortable with the core building blocks of python, specifically handling variables, performing math, taking user input, and using logic to solve simple problems.

TOOLS

software: google colab
language: python 3
modules: math (used for calculating the area of a circle)

THEORY

1. variables & formatting
multiple assignment: we can assign values to several variables at once, which keeps the code compact.
separators: the sep parameter helps us control how items look when printed—like putting each item on a new line.
f-strings: these are used to inject variables directly into text, making the output easy for humans to read.
2. data types & conversion
type checking: using the type() function helps us confirm if a piece of data is a whole number, a decimal, or text.
casting: since python takes all keyboard input as text, we manually convert it to int or float so we can do math with it.
3. automation with lists
list comprehensions: instead of writing five lines of code to get five subject marks, we use a single line to loop and collect the data.
math functions: built-in tools like sum() and len() make it easy to find totals and averages without manual addition.
4. geometry & logic
formulas: we implemented standard math formulas for circles (area) and rectangles (area and perimeter).
calculator logic: we used if-elif-else blocks to let the program "choose" which math operation to run based on what the user types.
safety checks: we added logic to prevent the program from crashing if a user tries to divide by zero.


CONCLUSION

this experiment shows how just a few lines of python can handle complex tasks like grade calculation and geometric mapping. by using smart tools like list comprehensions and f-strings, we made the code both efficient and readable. all the objectives, from simple variables to a functioning calculator, were successfully completed.
